The very thought disturbs him as well as his best friend and confidante, Mazikeen (Lesley-Ann Brandt), a fierce demon in the form of a beautiful young woman. The murder attracts the attention of LAPD homicide detective CHLOE DECKER, who initially is dismissive of Lucifer. But she becomes intrigued by his talent for drawing out people's secrets and his desire to dispense justice, doling out punishment to those who deserve it.

At the same time, God's emissary, the angel Amendiel (D.B. Woodside), has been sent to Los Angeles to convince Lucifer to return to the underworld can the Devil incarnate be tempted toward the side of Good, or will his original calling pull him back toward Evil?**
